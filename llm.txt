Used LLM: Chatgpt
Motivation: after writing my node code it didn't work as I had expected so I asked llm if it would know what is going wrong

The LLM was able to correct the code to be more inline when the asyncronous nature of nodejs by suggesting the use of promises.
As the shell commands summon a new process node skips to next line in its own code after summoning the process.
So it fix it provided was to use promises and await for the tasks to finish.

The LLM was able to identify the problem and It suggested 3 different approaches to solve it.
The suggestion I implemented was the third option as I think it was the most flexible one.
This option could have been higher in the suggestions
