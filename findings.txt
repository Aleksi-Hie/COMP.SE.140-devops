So I tested the application on both my windows machine and raspberry pi running linux. What I noticed in common was the mounted diskspace seems to be the total system diskspace.
Also The boot time on the windows machine seems to start from when the docker engine was started. On the raspberrypi however it seemed to count the total system uptime as
I had only just installed the docker on it but the uptime showed 23 weeks.
